            <p>According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, vaping may be slightly less harmful than smoking. 
                They note that a person who smokes inhales about 7,000 chemicals, whereas vaping likely involves a lower number of chemicals. 
                The AHA note that vaping liquids contain fewer contaminants than cigarettes.
                The AHATrusted Source note that vaping liquids contain fewer contaminants than cigarettes. 
                However, they also state that vaping is not safe due to the following reasons:
                E-cigarettes contain a large dose of nicotine, a substance known to slow the development of brains in fetuses, children, and teens.
                The liquid that creates the vapor is dangerous to adults and children if they swallow or inhale it or get it on their skin.
                Vaping also delivers several dangerous chemicals, including diacetyl, cancer-causing chemicals, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
                Vaping may normalize smoking again as it becomes more popular.(source: Johns Hopkins Medicine)</p>

            <p>Many thousands of people in the UK have already stopped smoking with the help of an e-cigarette. 
                There's growing evidence that they can be effective.
                Using an e-cigarette can help you manage your nicotine cravings. 
                To get the best out of it, make sure you're using it as much as you need to and with the right strength of nicotine in your e-liquid.
                A major UK clinical trial published in 2019 found that, when combined with expert face-to-face support, people who used e-cigarettes to quit smoking were twice as likely to succeed as people who used other nicotine replacement products, such as patches or gum.
                You will not get the full benefit from vaping unless you stop smoking cigarettes completely. 
                You can get advice from a specialist vape shop or your local stop smoking service.
                Getting expert help from your local stop smoking service gives you the best chance of quitting smoking for good.</p>
